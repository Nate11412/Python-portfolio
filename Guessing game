# This is a guessing game I created with a random number generator.
# A random number between 1 and 100 is generated, and the goal is to guess it.
# If the guess is too low  a message will be displayed telling you to guess higher, if the guess is to high a message will tell you to guess lower
# After getting the correct number the game will tell you how many tries it took for you to guess the right number.
